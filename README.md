Introducing PhenoTrack, a revolutionary platform that transforms how we understand and interact with Earth's blooming cycles! Using NASA's MODIS vegetation indices and Landsat phenological metrics, PhenoTrack empowers users to explore seasonal plant patterns through an interactive 3D globe that literally pulses with life. Climate change is shifting blooming patterns worldwide and without accessible tools to track these shifts, communities lose critical timing for farming, conservation, and adaptation. PhenoTrack solves this by making complex satellite phenology data intuitive and actionable. We engineered our own AI, a machine learning model built on pyPhenology's framework that predicts next season's first bloom with remarkable accuracy based on location, species, and historical patterns. By democratizing space-derived phenological insights, PhenoTrack promotes climate resilience, supports sustainable agriculture, and inspires global awareness of our planet's changing rhythms.
